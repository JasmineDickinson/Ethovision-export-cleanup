# Ethovision-export-cleanup
These scripts take the raw excel exports from Ethovision and allow you to clean up and sort the data efficiently. There are .csv example files included names with corresponding to their respective script. These contain sample data from multiple experiments in which multiple behavioral features were recorded (like time in zones, frequency of entries, etc)
